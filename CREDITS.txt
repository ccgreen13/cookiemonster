Thanks:

Damon McCoy for testing this in his wireless lab and adding support 
for more esoteric 802.11 header options to dpkt.

Nick Weaver for conversation and discussion, and for the idea of adding
"bounce" attack support to coerce Google's single-signon mechanism
to generate cookies for arbitrary services and to demote secure cookies 
to their insecure versions.

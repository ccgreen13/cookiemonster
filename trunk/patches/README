This directory contains patches for the libraries cookiemonster uses.

The patches are:

dpkt-80211.diff

This patch adds 802.11 header support to dpkt.


lorcon-no-mac80211-radiotap.diff

This patch removes Radiotap headers from LORCON's mac80211 driver support. I
found this was needed to get injection to work when using the ipwraw-ng driver
set. It may not be needed for more recent versions of the ipw drivers.


lorcon-cardmax-crashfix.diff

This fixes a crashbug that happens on some systems due to an overflow in
LORCON's card list array.


pylorcon-paths.diff

This adjusts the paths pylorcon searches for the lorcon library so that it
works from the current working directory with a fresh build.



These patches should already be applied in "official" CookieMonster releases.
